## photoSET
 PhotoSet is an application that allows photographers to share their photos along with the basic camera settings used to capture each photo. 
 
# Approach Taken
  PhotoSET uses a React front end to consume a Ruby on Rails API. 
  Photos are stored as assets on Cloudinary and then rendered on the front end through the API.
  
 # Technology Used
  - React
  - Ruby on Rails
  - Cloudinary
  - HTML
  - React-Carousel
  - CSS

# Something New
  For this project I taught myself image and file uploading through an external service and how to render them on a front end.
  I also learned how to fail... HARD.
